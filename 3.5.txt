Q3.5 The Bourne shell, Bourne-again shell, and Korn shell notation
digit1>&digit2
says to redirect descriptor digit1 to the same file as descriptor digit2. What is the difference
between the two commands shown below? (Hint: The shells process their command lines
from left to right.)
./a.out > outfile 2>&1
./a.out 2>&1 > outfile


ANS:
    
    -The keyboard is the standard input device while your screen is the standard output device
    -">" is the output redirection operator. ">>" appends output to an existing file
    -"<" is the input redirection operator
    -">&"re-directs output of one file to another.
    -You can re-direct error using its corresponding File Descriptor 2.


1.   ./a.out > outfile 2>&1
		When we execute above command, the output and the errors which we will get stored in file "outfile"
		./a.out is an executable file. when we execute this file either we will get output or sometime we will get error or both.
		>2 represent stansered error and >1 represent standard output. so the output and the error which we will get, that stored in 
		file "outfile.". Whene we execute a command "cat outfile" it shows the contents of file.


2.   ./a.out 2>&1>outfile
		It mean that standerd output descriptor first copied onto standared error descriptor and then standared error redirect to 
		outfile.
