4.1 Modify the program in Figure 4.3 to use stat instead of lstat. What changes if one of the command-line arguments is a symbolic link?

ANS:
	if we are using lstat and we pass symbolic link file the it will gives you an information about symbolic link. and it tell you the file type is symbolic link
	Whereas instead if latat if we use stat and we pass symbolic link as command line argument it will tell us that this file is regular file not a symbolic link.
